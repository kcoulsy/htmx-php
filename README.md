# Product Pagination Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of product pagination using basic PHP and htmx. Pagination is a common feature in web applications, allowing users to navigate through a set of products efficiently.

I wanted to see what the fuss is about with [htmx](https://htmx.org/) and it honestly worked pretty nicely. I took it old school with some procedural php and basic bootstrap styling.

## Technologies Used

- PHP: Server-side scripting language used for backend logic.
- htmx: Lightweight JavaScript library for AJAX requests and dynamic HTML updates.
- HTML/CSS: Frontend markup and styling.

## Features

- Display a list of products with basic information.
- Implement pagination to navigate through multiple pages of products.
- Use htmx for seamless AJAX-based loading of paginated content.
